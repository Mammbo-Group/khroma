# Khroma

Khroma is a ClojureScript library which provides access to Chrome Extension API. It wraps API with idiomatic functions 
and heavily uses core.async for asynchronous API interaction.

Khroma is still a work in progress, so not all APIs are implemented and well tested. The long term goal is to cover all Chrome 
and Chrome OS API's to make use of ClojureScript for extensions and applications development as convenient as possible.


## Upgrading

Khroma 0.20 contains breaking changes from 0.1.0. Make sure you read the change log.


## Installation

Add the following dependency to your `project.clj` file:

```clojure
[khroma "0.1.0"]
```

## Usage Example

```clojure
(ns example
  (:require [khroma.runtime :as runtime))
  
  
; receive messages for extension  
(let [messages (runtime/on-message)]
  (go-loop [] 
    (when-let [message (<! messages)]
      (process-message message)
      (recur)))
      
; send message to another extension      
(runtime/send-message 
   {:message-data "xx" :something-else "yyy"}
   {:extensionId "some.other.extension"
    :responseCallback 
      (fn [response]
        (handle-response response))})
```
